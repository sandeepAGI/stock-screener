Please review the technical_requirements file and come up with a plan to implement Phase 1, 2 and 3 of the requirements
Phase 1 is absolutely critical to the success of the project and so let us spend as much time as needed to be able to get data for the S&P 500
We need to evaluate each potential source and pick the one with the best data and least missing values
It is important that we always test as we are going through phases - need to also do unit and regression testing
