Our focus here is to understand "refresh_sentiment_only() - Requires additional work for proper Reddit data persistence" and come up with a plan to fix
Need to look at existing utilities in src and its subdirectories before we write any code
Repeat - resuse before we rewrite
Let us find the root cause and come up with a robust plan
After we complete, we will update next-steps.md and then commit changes
