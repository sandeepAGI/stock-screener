Please review UX-PLAN and README to get upto speed
I would like to implement a little branding in the Streamlit Analytics Dashbaord
For the header "Stock Outlier Analysis - S&P 500" can we use the color code #60B5E5?
Can we use Montserrat as our font?
Can we also incorporate the logo, that I have added to the data sub-directory to the top of the page?
