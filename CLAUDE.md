# StockAnalyzer Pro - Current Status & Development Guide
**Last Updated:** September 28, 2025
**Branch:** demo
**Purpose:** Consolidated documentation for current system state and development priorities

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### Critical Issues to Fix:
1. **Reddit Sentiment Calculation** - All 1,464 Reddit posts have `sentiment_score = 0.0`
2. **Dashboard Consolidation** - Two implementations causing maintenance confusion
3. **Data Management UI** - streamlit_app.py has potential tuple unpacking errors

## 📊 SYSTEM STATUS OVERVIEW

### ✅ WORKING COMPONENTS

#### Database & Storage
- **503 stocks** tracked in S&P 500 universe
- **993 fundamental records** with complete financial metrics
- **125,756 price records** for technical analysis
- **17,497 news articles** for sentiment analysis
- **1,464 Reddit posts** collected (but sentiment not calculated)
- **896 calculated metrics** with composite scores

#### Data Collection
- ✅ `DataCollectionOrchestrator` fully functional
- ✅ All refresh methods exist and can fetch data:
  - `refresh_fundamentals_only()` - Fetches and stores fundamental data
  - `refresh_prices_only()` - Fetches and stores price data
  - `refresh_news_only()` - Fetches and stores news articles
  - `refresh_sentiment_only()` - Fetches Reddit posts BUT doesn't calculate sentiment

#### Calculation Engines
- ✅ `FundamentalCalculator` - P/E, EV/EBITDA, PEG, FCF Yield calculations
- ✅ `QualityCalculator` - ROE, ROIC, debt ratios, current ratio
- ✅ `GrowthCalculator` - Revenue/EPS growth, stability metrics
- ✅ `SentimentCalculator` - News sentiment (works), Reddit sentiment (partial)
- ✅ `CompositeCalculator` - 40/25/20/15 weighted scoring system

#### Utilities
- ✅ `utilities/smart_refresh.py` - Intelligent data refresh with S&P 500 tracking
- ✅ `utilities/backup_database.py` - Database backup and restore
- ✅ `utilities/update_analytics.py` - Recalculates all metrics

### 🚨 BROKEN/INCOMPLETE COMPONENTS

#### Reddit Sentiment (Priority: CRITICAL)
- **Issue:** `refresh_sentiment_only()` in `src/data/collectors.py:549` sets all sentiment to 0.0
- **Impact:** 1,464 Reddit posts collected but none have calculated sentiment scores
- **Fix Required:** Integrate `SentimentAnalyzer` from `src/data/sentiment_analyzer.py`

#### Dashboard Fragmentation (Priority: HIGH)
- **Two Implementations:**
  1. `streamlit_app.py` (1,885 lines) - Complex with data management features
  2. `analytics_dashboard.py` (1,063 lines) - Simple with better UX
- **Issues:**
  - streamlit_app.py may have tuple unpacking errors
  - Maintenance overhead from duplicate implementations
  - User confusion about which to use

### ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION

#### Data Quality
- Reddit sentiment coverage: 0% (all scores are 0.0)
- News sentiment coverage: Working properly
- Quality thresholds: Restored to 50%+ requirements

## 🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

```
Data Flow:
Yahoo Finance ─┐
               ├─→ DataCollectionOrchestrator ─→ SQLite Database ─→ Calculators ─→ Dashboard
Reddit API ────┘                                      ↓
                                            calculated_metrics table
                                                      ↓
                                              Composite Scores (40/25/20/15)
```

### Key Database Tables:
- `stocks` - S&P 500 constituent tracking
- `fundamental_data` - Financial metrics from Yahoo Finance
- `price_data` - Historical price data
- `news_articles` - News headlines and summaries
- `reddit_posts` - Reddit discussion data (sentiment not calculated)
- `calculated_metrics` - Final composite scores

## 🔧 DEVELOPMENT PLAN

### Phase 1: Fix Reddit Sentiment (IMMEDIATE)
**Location:** `src/data/collectors.py:refresh_sentiment_only()`

**Current Code (Line 549):**
```python
sentiment_score=0.0,  # Will be calculated later
data_quality_score=0.7  # Default quality score
```

**Required Changes:**
1. Import `SentimentAnalyzer` from `src/data/sentiment_analyzer.py`
2. Calculate sentiment for each post before storing
3. Calculate data quality based on engagement metrics

**Existing Utilities to Reuse:**
- `SentimentAnalyzer.analyze_text()` - Combined TextBlob + VADER analysis
- `SentimentAnalyzer.analyze_reddit_posts()` - Batch Reddit sentiment with vote weighting

### Phase 2: Dashboard Consolidation
1. Test both dashboards thoroughly to identify specific errors
2. Decide on primary dashboard (recommend streamlit_app.py for features)
3. Port best UX features from analytics_dashboard.py:
   - Interactive weight sliders (40/25/20/15 adjustable)
   - Professional CSS styling with Montserrat fonts
   - Comprehensive methodology guide

### Phase 3: Data Management Fixes
1. Debug tuple unpacking errors in streamlit_app.py
2. Test data versioning functionality
3. Ensure refresh operations work through UI

## 📋 TESTING COMMANDS

### Quick System Check:
```bash
# Database status
sqlite3 data/stock_data.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reddit_posts WHERE sentiment_score != 0.0"

# Test refresh
python utilities/smart_refresh.py --symbols AAPL --data-types sentiment --force --quiet

# Launch dashboards
streamlit run streamlit_app.py  # Port 8501
streamlit run analytics_dashboard.py  # Different port
```

### Reddit Sentiment Verification:
```sql
-- Check Reddit data quality
SELECT symbol, COUNT(*) as posts,
       AVG(sentiment_score) as avg_sentiment,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN sentiment_score != 0.0 THEN 1 END) as calculated
FROM reddit_posts
GROUP BY symbol
ORDER BY posts DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 📖 REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION

- **Methodology Details:** See METHODS.md for scoring algorithms
- **Historical Context:** Archived documentation in docs/archive/
- **API Configuration:** Check .env.example for required keys

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Database Backups:** Always backup before major changes
   ```bash
   python utilities/backup_database.py
   ```

2. **Quality Thresholds:** Currently set to 50%+ for components, 60% overall
   - Location: `src/calculations/composite.py:93-99`
   - These were restored from relaxed values after fixing refresh methods

3. **Reddit API:** Requires valid credentials in .env file
   - REDDIT_CLIENT_ID
   - REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET
   - REDDIT_USER_AGENT

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Implement Reddit sentiment calculation** using existing SentimentAnalyzer
2. **Test both dashboards** to identify specific error conditions
3. **Create migration plan** to consolidate dashboard implementations
4. **Update this documentation** as fixes are completed
