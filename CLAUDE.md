Please review the README.md and the code base to understand the current state
We are having issues in the data management module that we need to fix as a priority before we can proceed further
Review DATA-TRACE.md which has results from a trace of the code base that I ran
Go through each of the identified issues and first confirm if that is actually an issue or not
If it is an issue, review the suggested fix, fix it, test to make sure that its working and then proceed to the next item
Once we have fully reviewed and implemented all the recommendation, please rerun all our tests and we should get to 100% pass rate
