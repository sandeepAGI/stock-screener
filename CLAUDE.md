Hi, please review all the md documents that have been updated in the last two days
Also review the last 10 commits to get a good understanding of current state
I would like us to next test two key utilities - refresh_data.py and backup_database.py
For each, we need to make sure that it works without making any changes to files in src
Once we have confirmed that they work, let us evaluate if we still need the load_sp500_baseline.py script in scripts subfolder
Also evaluate all the additional small programs we have recently added to see if they are needed or their functionality is covered by these utilities
Share recommendation on what to clean up and consolidate
After we make all updates, please update README and then commit changes and push to github
thanks
